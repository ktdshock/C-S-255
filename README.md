1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The owner of DriverPass wants to design a website for training drivers. The owner wants students to receive proper training due to a large percentage of students failing.

The client is the owner for DriverPass, and he would like a system built for student drivers to register for driver course training.

The system being designed must be browser or app based. The system should allow users to create their own account and be able to select a certian package offered for driving instruction. The user will be able to receive online training, take online exams and get on the road training as well. The owner will have access to all the accounts of the students and employees.

2. What did you do particularly well?

I've never created UML diagrams before and from the begining of the class to the end I was able to improve my design quite well. I enjoyed playing the roll of a system designer and using my skills to create everything the owner wanted.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would change the way I took down notes for what the product owner wanted. I was able to imporve this over time as the class went on but I would put much more detail in if I had to do it again.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I broke down all of the requirments that were being asked of me. I wanted to make sure I got each piece of the requirments seperate so I could more easily implement exactly what the owner wanted. (Client, Student, Owner, and Employees)

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Designing software involves several steps to make sure it meets users needs and works well. First, talk to the people who will use the software to understand what they want. Write down these requirements clearly. Next, check if it's possible to build the software with the available technology, if it fits into current operations, and if it's cost-effective.

Then, plan the structure of the system using diagrams and choose the right design style. Create detailed designs for each part of the system, including how it will look and work. Use modeling techniques like UML diagrams and ER diagrams to visualize the system. Make prototypes, or early models, of the software to gather feedback and improve the design.

Identify potential risks and develop plans to handle them. Verify and validate the design through reviews and user testing. Document the design process and provide user guides.
